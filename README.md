<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Wiki Movies Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://macamonper.github.io/wiki-movies/)

This repository is a project made for ADA. I used the movie database API and JSX to create a web page where you can browse different movies, series or actors by differents categories.
You will be able to use a searchbar that will bring you every result store in the Api.




### Built With


* [HTML]
* [React]
* [MUI](https://mui.com/)
* [THE MOVIE DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)



See the [open issues](https://github.com/macamonper/wiki-movie/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
